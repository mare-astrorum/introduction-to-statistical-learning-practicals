# Scaling the variables effects the max height of 
# the dendogram obtained from hierarchical clustering. 
# From a cursory glance, it doesnâ€™t effect the 
# bushiness of the tree obtained. However, it 
# does affect the clusters obtained from cutting 
# the dendogram into 3 clusters. In my opinion, 
# for this data set the data should be standardized 
# because the data measured has different units 
# (UrbanPop compared to other three columns).
# 
# Data should be scaled because the variances
# of the data sets are quite different.
