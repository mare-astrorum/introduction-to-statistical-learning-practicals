Chapter 5, Exercise 2


(a) Probability that jth IS an observation = 1/n; probability that it ISN'T is 1-1/n

(b) The same 1 - 1/n, because of replacement

(c) There are 'n' possible times of equal probability of 'n' to be picked

(d) 1 - (1 - 1/5)^5 = 0.67232

(e) 1 - (1 - 1/100)^100 = 0.6339677

(f) 1 - (1 - 1/10000)^10000 = 0.632139

(h) The observation 0.637 comes close to the predicted value 0.632139



Chapter 5, Exercise 3


(a) Dataset divided in a number of equal parts, one part held out for validation, the rest are
used for training. Then move to the next part that's held out for validation and so on.

(b) i. Validation set only uses half of the data & there's a lot of variability between test runs
ii. LOOCV has low bias but the data are shared between different runs, so overfitting occurs, also
computationally heavy.

Get the standard error using bootstrap and from there calculate standard deviation.
