# This problem is a continuation of 
# the previous exercise. In a toy
# example with p = 100, show that 
# one can approximate the multiple
# linear regression coefficient estimates 
# by repeatedly performing simple
# linear regression in a backfitting 
# procedure. How many backfitting
# iterations are required in order to 
# obtain a “good” approximation to
# the multiple regression coefficient e
# stimates? Create a plot to justify
# your answer.
